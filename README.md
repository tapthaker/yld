## YLD - Linker

- This is an experimental project with the main motive to understand how a linker works
- It is currently constrained to work for Linux **86_64** architecture ELF files
- Tasks:
    - [x] Parse ELF Object Files ( Done using [ELFIO](https://github.com/serge1/ELFIO) )
    - [x] Validate that they are generated for **86_64** architecture
    - [x] Symbol Resolution
    - [] Relocation
    - [] Generate Binary
    - [] Support Shared-Library
    - [] Other steps that I might be forgetting
